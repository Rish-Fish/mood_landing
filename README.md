# mood_landing

This is my first site made with html and css.
I start it on course by JavaGuru.lv and then I have been creating and finishing it on my own.
I tried make it responsive using flex-box and @media rule.
Also I made some simple slider, sticky menu and sticky button "Go To Top".
(I didn't have layout for work, just a PNG image)

Update:
I got some experience, cleaned up the code, used animation library aos.js and added a mobile menu in js.
