# mood_landing
This is my first site made with html and css.
I start it on course by GavaGuru.lv and then I have been creating and finising it on my own.
I thied make it responsive using flex-box and @media.
Also I made some simple slider, sticky menu and sticky buttom "GoToTop".
It was not easy for me, but I finised it and almost heppy with the result. 
(I didn't have layout for work, just a PNG image)
